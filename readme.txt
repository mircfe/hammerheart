Hammerheart is a project I came up with while learning the Godot framework. It’s a platformer starring Hammerheart, a Viking blacksmith who sets off on a journey through a castle to rescue his beloved—basically the most classic 80s-style plot. :-)

The game is currently in development. I created the initial main menu and the first level.

To build this mini platformer, I used visual and audio assets found online across various platforms. I’ll do my best to list them all here to properly credit each author.

I apologize in advance for any unintentional omissions. If you notice any of your resources being used in this project without attribution, please let me know and I’ll add the proper credits right away.
